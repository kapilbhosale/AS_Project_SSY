    <string name="About">About:</string>
    <string name="About_Info">Samajwadi Party came into existence on October 4, 1992 in Lucknow under the leadership of Shri Mulayam Singh Yadav.</string>
    <string name="Decription">Description:</string>
    <string name="Description_Info">The Samajwadi Party believes in creating a socialist society, which works on the principle of equality and the party has a secular and democratic outlook. The Samajwadi Party believes in continuously working towards the upliftment of weaker sections of society and it stands against communal forces.\n\n

Freedom fighter, socialist and a great Parliamentarian, Ram Manohar Lohia is a guiding light for the Samajwadi Party. Ram Manohar Lohia’s integrity, selfless struggle for India’s independence and his ability to unite people of all sections of society has greatly influenced the leaders, youth and workers in the party. Lohia was jailed by the British several times during the freedom struggle and he fought rigorously all his life for social equality.\n\n

Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas greatly influenced Lohia who worked tirelessly during the freedom movement writing articles against the British, raising awareness against British imperialism in Europe, and after India became independent devoted himself to grassroots politics which included farmers cause, development work and fighting against social injustice. He also worked towards putting an end to capitalist-feudalistic tendencies.\n\n

Lohia’s ability to awaken the people with his fiery articles on Satyagraha and his innate knowledge of social problems made him the foremost socialist leader of India. Lohia’s ‘Do or Die’ spirit is an inspiration and a guiding force for the Samajwadi Party in its struggle for social upliftment of the poor, backward and socially weaker sections of society.</string>
